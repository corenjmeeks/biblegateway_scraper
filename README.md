# This is my first code attempt on gitHub

# I started learning 6 months ago and thought this would be a fun and easy project

# This code uses the python modules: Requests, Re, and BeautifulSoup, you will need to download them for it to work
 
# The function accepts one argument, a string called "url", and it will pull verses from biblegateway.com and return it in JSON format

# Copy and paste the url from the chapter you want and save to a variable, then pass the variable to the biblescraper function

# url = "https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark+2&version=NIV"
# mark_2 = biblescraper(url)

# Make sure you assign the function to a variable to save the results. 
# The keys are integers corresponding to the verse in the chapter you chose

# for example: the key mark_2[17], will print:
"On hearing this, Jesus said to them, “It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick. I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners.”

# This is ONLY for learning purposes for my personal use. Feel free to use it if you want and please see the terms and conditions on biblegateway.com for any questions about how you can use the data. Thanks and God bless!
